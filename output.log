semantic-release cannot push the version tag to the branch feature/card-1111 on the remote Git repository with URL https://x-access-token:%24%7BGH_TOKEN%7D@github.com/alexottonizup/application.git.

This can be caused by:

    * a misconfiguration of the repositoryUrl (https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/blob/master/docs/usage/configuration.md#repositoryurl) option
    * the repository being unavailable
    * or missing push permission for the user configured via the Git credentials on your CI environment (https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/blob/master/docs/usage/ci-configuration.md#authentication)

SemanticReleaseError: Cannot push to the Git repository.
